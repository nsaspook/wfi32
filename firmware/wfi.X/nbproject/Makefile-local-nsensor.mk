# Generated Makefile - do not edit!

#
# This file contains information about the location of compilers and other tools.
# If you commmit this file into your revision control server, you will be able to 
# to checkout the project and build it from the command line with make. However,
# if more than one person works on the same project, then this file might show
# conflicts since different users are bound to have compilers in different places.
# In that case you might choose to not commit this file and let MPLAB X recreate this file
# for each user. The disadvantage of not commiting this file is that you must run MPLAB X at
# least once so the file gets created and the project can be built. Finally, you can also
# avoid using this file at all if you are only building from the command line with make.
# You can invoke make with the values of the macros:
# $ makeMP_CC="/opt/microchip/mplabc30/v3.30c/bin/pic30-gcc" ...
